# 📄 Python Sales Data BST Parser

This is a simple command-line project I built in Python to practice data parsing, file I/O, and implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) from scratch.  
It loads sales-style data from a CSV file, inserts it into a BST, and allows users to search or display the entries through a menu interface.

The project includes structured OOP design with classes for bids, tree nodes, and the full BST, along with a clean CLI flow for interaction.
